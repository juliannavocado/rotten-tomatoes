# rotten-tomatoes

The Rotten Tomatoes homework assignment is an exercise in web scraping and pulling movie review data from the Rotten Tomatoes website. There is also some dabbling in NLP towards the end. Packages used include Beautiful Soup, Pandas, and SKLearn. 

The project takes a list of movies (musicals in my case), loops through each name to attach to the Rotten Tomatoes URL, and stores the rating ("Rotten" or "Fresh") along with the review in a .txt file. Then, there are two working classifiers, one using the Count method and the other TF-IDF.
